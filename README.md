# Swift-Student-Challenge-25
# Slidey

This app is intended to be run on an actual iPad (not the simulator). For the best possible experience please ensure the app is in landscape orientation on a bigger size iPad, such as the iPad Air or iPad Pro. 

Compiling on an iPad via the Playgrounds App does not allow for the Camera preview to work in the AR Experience App. The object view is still functional. Compiling through Xcode does not have this issue.

The initial run on an iPad from Playgrounds may cause a blank screen to show up. This appears to be a bug in playgrounds. Restarting the app allows it to work fine. 

## The Project
- Help save WWDC by sending over the WWDC Keynote to the Apple team.
- 6 total 'mini-apps' (Slidey, Messages, Keynote, Notes, Countdown, and AR Experience).
- Desktop like experience with draggable windows and menus.
- Slidey is powered by SwiftUI, UIKit, PencilKit, ARKit, and QuickLook.
